    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to our coding workshop! Today, you will embark on an exciting project: building a tribute page about a
        topic that you are passionate about, but that also has a bit of controversy around it. This exercise will not
        only help you hone your web development skills but also allow you to practice structuring and presenting a
        persuasive argument.
    </p>
    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p> Create a tribute webpage that presents a contentious issue you care deeply about. Your page should argue your perspective clearly, provide well-cited evidence, and include a thesis statement. Additionally, you will incorporate a coded table to display relevant data supporting your argument.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li> Choose Your Topic: Select a topic that you are passionate about and that has some level of controversy. This could be anything from environmental issues, technology debates, social justice topics, to ethical dilemmas in various fields.
        </li>
        <li>Thesis Statement: Craft a clear and concise thesis statement that outlines your position on the topic. This statement should guide the content of your page.</li>
        <li>Content and Structure:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Introduction: Introduce your topic and present your thesis statement.</li>
                <li>Argument: Develop your argument with several supporting points. Each point should be clearly articulated and backed by credible sources.</li>
                <li>Citations: Include at least three citations from reputable sources to support your argument. These can be in the form of quotes, data, or references.</li>
                <li>Table: Create a table using HTML and CSS to display data that supports your argument. This could include statistics, comparison data, timelines, etc.</li>
                <li>Images: Be sure to include images that support your thesis within your project.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
        <li> Lastly, we will link our readers to a page that highlights more information about this character so that
            they can read more about them on their own.</li>
    </ol>
